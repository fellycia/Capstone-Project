    "Many e-commerce prompt users to leave a review after purchasing an item from their website to understand a customer's experience. Reviews can affect another customers' decision on whether to purchase or not. Customers would judge the quality of an item based on previous customers' feedback. As part of the data scientist team in Consultancy of food product, we aim to classify the sentiment of reviews and to see if there are any potential roadblocks to customers' satisfaction."

You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea &amp; headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!</td>\n",

I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past. Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat.\n",

       "10  Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS! Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read \"maltitol\" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!\n",

My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me."

I couldn't really taste the sea salt flavor though.\""

They're incredibly good for you, made with date paste (which you can't taste), and sweetened with juice concentrates. Lower in sugar, and they have fiber!

Wines fermented with the K1V-1116 have very low volatile acidity, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and foam production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The K1V-1116 strain tends to express the freshness of white grape varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Seyval. The natural fresh fruit aromas are retained longer than with other standard yeast strains. Fruit wines and wines made from concentrates poor in nutrient balance benefit from the capacity of K1V-1116 to adapt to difficult fermentation conditions. Restarts stuck fermentations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for dry whites, aged reds, and late harvest wines.</td>\n",

       "232  Review ICV K1V-1116<br />Saccharomyces cerevisiae<br /><br />Origin<br />Selected by the Institut coop&eacute;ratif du vin in Montpellier among numerous killer strains isolated and studied by Pierre Barre at INRA, the K1V-1116 strain was the first competitive factor yeast to go into commercial production and has become one of the most widely used active dried wine yeasts in the world.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The K1V-1116 strain is a rapid starter with a constant and complete fermentation between 10° and 35°C (50° and 95°F), capable of surviving a number of difficult conditions, such as low nutrient musts and high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) or sugar. Wines fermented with the K1V-1116 have very low volatile acidity, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and foam production.<br /><br />The K1V-1116 strain tends to express the freshness of white grape varieties such as Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Seyval. The natural fresh fruit aromas are retained longer than with other standard yeast strains. Fruit wines and wines made from concentrates poor in nutrient balance benefit from the capacity of K1V-1116 to adapt to difficult fermentation conditions. Restarts stuck fermentations.<br /><br />Highly recommended for dry whites, aged reds, and late harvest wines.   \n",

       "      <td>Tastes Like Salty Tofu, Basically I haven't had vienna sausage since childhood, and even then I only had them occasionally, at other people's houses.  These were much less flavorful and much saltier than I remembered.  They aren't bad; they are basically tasteless, much like tofu.  I would suggest to anyone thinking about buying these to see if the company markets a low sodium version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \"pink slime\" scare is a bit exaggerated in its details.  Still it's unnerving.  However, I had heard so many times from family friends and associates who are Native American and Chinese doctors etc. about how healthful it is to consume more than just the muscle tissue of animals, that I gave it some thought.  \"Pink slime\" does not contain every type of animal part.  Notably it will contain some highly beneficial parts we don't normally eat in the U.S., such as tendons and ligaments.

       "8   Tastes Like Salty Tofu, Basically I haven't had vienna sausage since childhood, and even then I only had them occasionally, at other people's houses.  These were much less flavorful and much saltier than I remembered.  They aren't bad; they are basically tasteless, much like tofu.  I would suggest to anyone thinking about buying these to see if the company markets a low sodium version.<br /><br />The \"pink slime\" scare is a bit exaggerated in its details.  Still it's unnerving.  However, I had heard so many times from family friends and associates who are Native American and Chinese doctors etc. about how healthful it is to consume more than just the muscle tissue of animals, that I gave it some thought.  \"Pink slime\" does not contain every type of animal part.  Notably it will contain some highly beneficial parts we don't normally eat in the U.S., such as tendons and ligaments.  These actually are very healthy items featured in the cuisines of a number of cultures.  Not only am I unlikely to sit down to a nice bowl of Chinese beef tendons (which I don't think I could even chew up), but have you priced these products in the ethnic markets?  Very expensive.  So, if that's the case, and these cheapo little hotdogs offer the same thing, then maybe they warranted my reconsideration.  That was my line of thought, anyway.<br /><br />So - something to consider for those who are suffering from ailments such as arthritis or other bone and joint issues.

To me this was more like a side dish. The flavor was okay, then again I'm just not a fan of most store-bought microwavable Indian dishes. I added 3 slices of Kraft American cheese and turned this into a dip for some Tostitos Scoops. Not bad.   \n",
